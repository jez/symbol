# Symbol

> A build tool for Standard ML

🚧 This project is unfinished and ongoing. Pardon our ~~dust~~ TODOs. 🚧

Symbol is a work in progress build tool for Standard ML. It's designed to work
alongside and on top of existing SML build tools, like SML/NJ's CM and MLton's
MLBasis files. Symbol's key features are:

- **Designed to build executables**

  Symbol builds and installs runnable executables for your project. With SML/NJ,
  these executables use heap images under the hood, while MLton generates linked
  binaries. These details are internal; the end result is always an executable
  that you can invoke from the command line.

- **Low friction for collaborators**

  Symbol's executable is designed to be checked into your project's version
  control. This means your collaborators do not have to install Symbol globally
  before they can build your project.

- **Built on `make`**

  As much as possible, Symbol uses `make` to cache previous build steps. All
  intermediate outputs are stored into a `.symbol-work` folder in your current
  directory, and it's always safe to delete this folder. Running `symbol make` a
  second time should usually be instant.

- **Scaffold new projects**

  The `symbol new` command is how you initialize new Standard ML projects. It
  prepopulates CM and MLBasis files and copies the Symbol scripts into your
  project, so you can jump write into your project.

- **Convention over configuration**

  Symbol infers information about your project from its structure. This means
  that Symbol does not come with yet another file format to configure your
  project; just keep using `*.cm` files for SML/NJ and `*.mlb` files for MLton.

TODO(jez) Screencast

## Install globally

Global installation is **only required** by the collaborators who initially set
up symbol in a project. The global command is called `symbol-new` and is solely
for scaffolding new projects. Once a Symbol project has been created, a script
called `symbol` will exist locally within that project.

### macOS

On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install jez/formulae/symbol-new
```

### From source

You can also install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jez/symbol
cd symbol
make install
```

This will install to `~/.local/bin/symbol-new`. If you'd like to install to
a different prefix, you can pass that to the `make` command. For example,

```bash
make install prefix=/usr/local
```

will instead install to `/usr/local/bin/symbol-new`.


## Quickstart

Create a new project with the global command:

```bash
symbol-new <target>
```

This creates a new folder called `<target>` and initializes it with build
files and a "Hello, world!" program to get your project started.

Once the global `symbol-new` has been used to scaffold a new project, these
commands are availble:

```bash
# Build the project (by default uses SML/NJ)
symbol make

# Build the project with MLton (takes longer, but makes faster executable)
symbol make with=mlton

# Build the project (by default uses MLton), then install to ~/.local/bin
symbol install

# same as above, but installs to /usr/local/bin
symbol install prefix=/usr/local
```

For complete usage information, be sure to check the help output of both the
global and local command:

```bash
# Global
symbol-new --help

# Local
symbol --help
```


## Tips

TODO(jez) These tips are mostly fragments right now

- You're free to structure your project however you want as long as
  - it builds cleanly with just your `*.cm` file and/or `*.mlb` file
    - these files are in the top-level and are named how you want your
      executable named
  - these build files export a `Main.main` function
- in particular, you can pull in dependencies yourself and put them wherever you
  want (so you can use smackage if you want to)

- Make variables
  - MLTONFLAGS (profiling)
  - target (two executables)
  - main (main function called something else)

- consider adding .symbol-work/bin to your PATH

- Your sources.cm file should not try to hide anything.
  This makes it easier to reuse your sources.cm file for tests.
  If you want to keep things private when writing a library, expose a separate
  CM file for your library users with only the public interface.

## TODO

TODO(jez) set up https://symbol.sh

## Testing

TODO(jez) Add tests for edge cases

- `symbol version`
  - wc -l == 1

- `symbol version`
  - no .symbol-work folder

- `symbol`, `symbol -h`, `symbol --help`, `symbol help`

- errors
  - `symbol --foo`
    - bad subcommand
  - `symbol make --foo`
    - bad option
  - `symbol make foo`
    - bad positional arg
  - delete `TARGET.cm` and `TARGET.mlb`
    - could not infer `with=`
  - `symbol make with=foo`


- `with=smlnj`
  - generated executable is text file and references heap image

- `with=mlton`
  - generated executable is data file

- `with=smlnj` → `with=mlton` → `with=smlnj`
  - is SML/NJ executable, not MLton

- `[smlnj, mlton].each do`
  - generated executable has correct permissions

  - with=smlnj and with=mlton show error output if doesn't typecheck

  - `symbol make`, `symbol make`
    - only one line output for second command (just path of built executable)

  - `symbol make` populates `.symbol-work/debug.log` for each run
    - if there are errors, the error output is here too

  - `symbol install prefix=.`
    - either
      - bin/TARGET
      - lib/TARGET/TARGET.suffix
    - or
      - bin/TARGET
    - and then runs (even if you clean and delete src/ folder)


if CI:
  - `symbol install`
    - installs to `$HOME/.local/bin/TARGET`
    - runs (even if you clean and delete src/ folder)

- `symbol-new`
  - ensure hidden files show up

- `symbol-new --empty`
  - ensure count of files is only two

- `symbol-new`, `symbol-new --empty`
  - empty still works if the directory exists


- TODO(jez) grep for `error` logs and try to exercise them all

## Developer Notes

For historical context of implementation decisions, see
[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

To bump the version:

- Update the VERSION in `symbol-new`
- Commit the change, and create a new git tag with that version
- Make a new release on GitHub (`hub release`)
- Update the Homebrew formula
